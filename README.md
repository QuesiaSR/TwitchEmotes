# TwitchEmotes

A Fabric mod that brings the normal emojis, 7TV emotes, BTTV emotes and FFZ emotes to Minecraft!

If you want the mod to be ported to a specific version, open an issue or ask me in [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/s9m8gf6pju)!

## Features:

- Rendering emotes from 7TV, BTTV and FFZ in Minecraft chat.
- Messages from Twitch chat in Minecraft chat.

## How to set it up:

1. Launch and quit the game so that the configuration file gets created.
2. Head to `.minecraft/config/TwitchEmotes_v3.json`.
3. Go to [this website](https://chatterino.com/client_login) and log in. **Don't show this on stream!**
4. Press the Copy button and use that data to fill out the config file. (Don't include the `;`'s at the end of each property)
